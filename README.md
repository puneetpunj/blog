# Personal Portfolio

This repository contains a personal portfolio site. Configure Medium and resume/LinkedIn in `portfolio/config.json` and run the fetch script to populate blog posts.

The root `index.html` simply redirects to the `portfolio/` directory so the site can be served directly from GitHub Pages.

- Development: see `portfolio/README.md`.
